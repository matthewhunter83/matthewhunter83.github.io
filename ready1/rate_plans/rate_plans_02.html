                <li>Rate plans are the foundation of the service we provide to customers.</li>
                <li>This includes postpaid and prepaid plans.</li>
                <li>T-Mobile ONE, our flagship and industry-leading plan, created the end of customers having to worry about how much high-speed data they need.</li>
                <li>Customers don’t like getting a bill that is much more than they expected due to various taxes and fees, so being the Un-carrier, we solved that pain point.</li>
                <li>T-Mobile ONE, with taxes and fees included, removes the guesswork from how much the monthly bill is really going to be.</li>
                <li>While the basics of T-Mobile ONE are straightforward, there are some variations and details about the plan that are important to understand.</li>
                <li>T-Mobile Essentials provides customers with an entry level plan with only the necessities at an affordable price.</li>
                <li>Many customers still prefer the flexibility of prepaid.</li>
                <li>Customers will rely on your expertise to answer questions about available plans, and which might work best for them.</li>
                <li>During your DIY activity, you’ll dig into the details of T-Mobile rate plans.</li>
                <li>Be prepared to explain the benefits of each T-Mobile rate plan.</li>
                <li>In C2, you’ll notice lots of other rate plans – most of which are plans we offered in the past, but are now grandfathered.</li>
                <li>Plans are considered “grandfathered” when they are no longer offered for sale, even though existing customers may still have them.</li>
        </ul>
