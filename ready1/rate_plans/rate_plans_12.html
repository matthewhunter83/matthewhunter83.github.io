        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Review the content on the slide with the group.</li>
            <li>Have the learners bring their <b>Sales Floor Activities</b> packet with them and take notes as they observe and interact with the store team on the sales floor.</li>
            <li>If learners are unable to complete an activity or observe everything on the slide, additional time for sales floor activities is provided during the weekly review days. This is a good time for learners to go back through the weekâ€™s activities and fill in the blanks.</li>
