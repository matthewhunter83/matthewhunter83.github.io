        <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
        Split class into small groups of 2-3. No more than 3 people to allow everyone
        time to skill practice.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Review the instructions on the <b>Bring It Together</b> slide.</li>
            <li>For this activity, it is recommended that each group be assigned the following <a href="https://c2.t-mobile.com/docs/437605">video customers</a>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Allen (Millennial)</li>
                    <li>Scarlett (Server/Prepaid)</li>
                    <li>Carl (Family)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Learners may need to revisit the videos to refresh their memory.</li>
            <li>The videos won’t necessarily provide all the information they need. This is a good time for learners to capture what questions they would ask, to gather more information from the customer.</li>
            <li>The skill practice is for each person to play the role of one of the video customers while someone else plays the Mobile Associate.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>
                <b>OPTIONAL:</b> If facilitating a class with an odd number of participants, have one member of the group will be an observer.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="6">
            <li>
                As the Mobile Associate, they should ask open-ended questions to gain a full understanding of the customer’s needs and lifestyle.
                    <ul><li>Ask learners to give you the definition of open and closed questions. Lead a quick discussion on when you use each type and why.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you’ve gathered enough information, offer a personalized recommendation, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rate plan</li>
                        <li>Explanation of why you believe this plan will benefit them.</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Create a Purchase Estimate in T-Mobile Connect based off the rate plan recommended.</li>
            <li>Have the Mobile Associate send the Purchase Estimate to their own email.</li>
            <li>Rotate through until each person has been the Mobile Associate.</li>
        </ol>
