<!--Comments and examples - Collapsible section of code

Slide example. Replace [[Image URL]] with the url for the image in both locations. Slides should be placed logically between facilitator guide elements which may mean sometimes they are inbetween two paragraphs or lists.

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=[[Image URL]]"><img class="slide" src="[[Image URL]]"></a></div>

Topic example. This creates a magenta bar separating major sections of content and matches the magenta bars on the orientation guide.

        <h2>[[Topic]]</h2>

Action example. This creates a gray bar within a topic to further separate larger sections into smaller ones and is in the left column of the page.  Actions should not be present before the first topic.

        <h3>[[Action]]</h3>

Segment Topic example.  Page 3 of the Un-carrier Experience Principles facilitator guide has a few examples of this infrequently used element with the words Customer Focus and Simplicity.  Segment Topics are not sticky so they won't cling to the top of the window on the html, but they look different than bolded text on the rendered html.

        <h4>[[Segment Topic]]</h4>

Paragraph example.  Most of the facilitator guide is written in paragraphs.  Each <p> section should only contain one paragraph with no line breaks.  Inside of paragraphs, please use the <b></b> tag for bolded text, <i></i> for italicized text, <u></u> for underlined text, and <span class="magenta"></span> for magenta text enclosing the relevant text.

        <p>[[Facilitator guide paragraph]]</p>

Unordered/Ordered list example.  These are overused in the facilitator guides and are the most time consuming to set up because they are often nested many levels, and sometimes nested within paragraphs (<p>). Here as an example of how these should look, note where the text is located in the [[Item 2]] example in relation to it's nested list:

<ul>
    <li>[[Item 1]]</li>
    <li>[[Item 2]]
        <ul>
            <li>[[Sub-item 1]]</li>
            <li>[[Sub-item 2]]</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>[[Item 3]]</li>
</ul>

Replace <ul></ul> with <ol></ol> for ordered lists, and don't worry if the type of ordering is different than what the facilitator guide shows (T-Mobile is pretty inconsistent about it's ording system). Here are some samples to copy:

        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199544023220234/499607766109913119/Slide3.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199544023220234/499607766109913119/Slide3.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>Explain the following key points about Signature Moves in your own words.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Signature Moves are a huge part of what makes us the Un-carrier.</li>
        <li>They eliminate customer pain points.</li>
        <li>Because of them, we stand out against the competition.</li>
        <li><b>Match needs to Un-carrier Moves</b> is a big deal in the Interaction Model.</li>
        <li>With them, you have lots of answers to: "Why T-Mobile"?</li>
        <li>You've gotta have a killer network to have moves like us!</li>
        <li>They are born out of our bold Un-carrier spirit:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://tmobileusa.sharepoint.com/sites/howweplay">How We Play</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://c2.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-423276">Un-carrier Principles</a>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Some have been made obsolete by newer signature moves.</li>
        <li>It's a freakin' party when they're announced!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Action</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Display the Signature Moves Snapshot, and provide an overview of our current signature moves that they'll be researching next.
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Hit up our YouTube channel and show some examples of how we party when we launch a new signature move. Keep the energy high going into the next activity!</li>
        <ul>

    </ol>

<h2>DIY Activity</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This activity will enable Mobile Associates to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Explain the details of current Signature Moves.</li>
        <li>Distinguish between features and benefits of Signature Moves.</li>
        <li>Pair Signature Moves with customer needs, pain points, and lifestyles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ask</h3>
    <p>Who can tell me the difference between a feature and a benefit?</p>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>Lead the class in a brief discussion of features vs. benefits.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A feature is a factual statement about a product or service.</li>
        <li>A benefit answers the question "what's in it for me?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sure, features are important -- you gotta know your stuff.</p>
    <p>BUT customers care about benefits -- so keep your conversations focused there.</p>

    <h3>Debrief</h3>
    <p>See the slide titled <b>The Download</b>. Here are some ideas to check for understanding. Feel free to add your own!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Go down the list of current Signature Moves. For each move:
            <ul>
                <li>Ask for a volunteer to share theh feature and benefit they wrote down.</li>
                <li>Gather any questions from the group and answer them.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ask for volunteers to share their personal favorite, and what the big benefit for them is.</li>
        <li>Find out which Signature Move was the most difficult for the group to understand, and clear up any confusion.</li>
        <li>Which Signature Moves might customers not know about?
            <ul>
                <li>Hint: Carrier Freedom is very often overlooked! We often hear "I'd love to switch to T-Mobile, but I'm stuck in a contract with someone else."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Which tool did we learn about yesterday when we talked about Side-by-Side Selling that weaves Signature Moves into the customer conversation?
            <ul>
                <li>Answer: T-Mobile Connect > Customer Connect</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

        </li>
        <li>Groups should pick a Signature Move and identify the benefit quickly.</li>
        <li>The bulk of their time should be spent practicing the best way to bring up the Signature Move in a conversation with that customer.</li>
        <li>What you're looking for is a short, compelling sentence or two that ties the benefit of a Signature Move to that customer's situation.</li>
        <li>The goal is that the customer feels understood and wants to hear more.</li>
        <li>Reconvene the class and provide balanced feedback for each presentation.
            <ul>
                <li>Note: This is a good time to discuss what "balanced feedback" is!</li>

        <li>Was it hard to not talk about features?</li>
        <li>How can we avoid making a connection that's not there?</li>
        <li>Are you ready to talk about Signature Moves in your home store?</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Sales Floor Activities</h2>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>We're not done learning about Signature Moves. The fun has just begun!</p>
    <p>When your learners are out on the sales floor today, the group should be connecting the dots between what they learned in class and what they see in real life.</p>

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199544023220234/499607858107908096/Slide8.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199544023220234/499607858107908096/Slide8.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Review the content on the slide with the group.</li>
        <li>Have the learners bring their <b>Sales Floor Activities</b> packet with them and take notes as they observe and interact with the store team on the sales floor.</li>
        <li>If they are unable to complete an activity or observe everything on the slide, additional time for sales floor activities is provided during the weekly review days. This is a good time for learners to go back through the week's activities and fill in the blanks.</li>
    </ul>
