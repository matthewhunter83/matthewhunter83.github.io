<!--Comments and examples - Collapsible section of code

Slide example. Replace [[Image URL]] with the url for the image in both locations. Slides should be placed logically between facilitator guide elements which may mean sometimes they are inbetween two paragraphs or lists.

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=[[Image URL]]"><img class="slide" src="[[Image URL]]"></a></div>

Topic example. This creates a magenta bar separating major sections of content and matches the magenta bars on the orientation guide.

        <h2>[[Topic]]</h2>

Action example. This creates a gray bar within a topic to further separate larger sections into smaller ones and is in the left column of the page.  Actions should not be present before the first topic.

        <h3>[[Action]]</h3>

Segment Topic example.  Page 3 of the Un-carrier Experience Principles facilitator guide has a few examples of this infrequently used element with the words Customer Focus and Simplicity.  Segment Topics are not sticky so they won't cling to the top of the window on the html, but they look different than bolded text on the rendered html.

        <h4>[[Segment Topic]]</h4>

Paragraph example.  Most of the facilitator guide is written in paragraphs.  Each <p> section should only contain one paragraph with no line breaks.  Inside of paragraphs, please use the <b></b> tag for bolded text, <i></i> for italicized text, <u></u> for underlined text, and <span class="magenta"></span> for magenta text enclosing the relevant text.

        <p>[[Facilitator guide paragraph]]</p>

Unordered/Ordered list example.  These are overused in the facilitator guides and are the most time consuming to set up because they are often nested many levels, and sometimes nested within paragraphs (<p>). Here as an example of how these should look, note where the text is located in the [[Item 2]] example in relation to it's nested list:

<ul>
    <li>[[Item 1]]</li>
    <li>[[Item 2]]
        <ul>
            <li>[[Sub-item 1]]</li>
            <li>[[Sub-item 2]]</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>[[Item 3]]</li>
</ul>

Replace <ul></ul> with <ol></ol> for ordered lists, and don't worry if the type of ordering is different than what the facilitator guide shows (T-Mobile is pretty inconsistent about it's ording system). Here are some samples to copy:

        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>To introduce Mobile Associates to side-by-side selling.</p>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>Side-by-side selling -- we've talked about it a little already and you're going to hear more about it in the coming weeks!</p>

    <h3>Ask</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>What do we mean by "side-by-side selling?"</li>
        <li>Why do we do it?</li>
    </ul>

        <!--Slide 3--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199413831761931/499607488900104192/Slide3.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199413831761931/499607488900104192/Slide3.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Side-by-side selling is our way of making the customer feel like a partner, instead of a transaction.</li>
        <li>It means we're open and transparent with our customers.</li>
        <li>It's a subtle, yet powerful way to remove unseen barriers in a conversation.</li>
        <li>Although it's rather simple, executing it with strangers can feel uncomfortable, at first.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ask</h3>
    <p>How do we get comfortable with something that's uncomfortable?</p>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You're going to get lots of practice, throughout training, but first, let's be sure we know what we should be practicing.</li>
        <li>You've already told me what side-by-side selling is and why we do it.</li>
        <li>Now, let's discuss some tools you can use while side-by-side selling!</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Customer Connect</h2>
    
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Introduce Mobile Associates to the Purchase Estimate.</p>
    <p>After successfully completing this module, Mobile Associates will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe the Purchase Estimate and how it supports side-by-side selling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ask</h3>
    <p>Who remembers the five categories within Customer Connect?</p>

        <!--Slide 4--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199413831761931/499607514208534549/Slide4.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199413831761931/499607514208534549/Slide4.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>You will have time to <b>Explore and Discover</b> the other four categories later today during your Sales Floor Activities.</p>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Our customers have said they want simplicity from their wireless provider.</li>
        <li>They want to know exactly what they signed up for prior to leaving the store.</li>
        <li>We can provide a collaborative and interactive approach to side-by-side selling with the help from some of our digital tools.</li>
        <li>The tool we will be learning today is called the Purchase Estimate.</li>
        <li>Purchase Estimate lives inside Customer Connect and is on every REMO in our stores.</li>
    </ul>

        <!--Slide 5--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199413831761931/499607538518458370/Slide5.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199413831761931/499607538518458370/Slide5.png"></a></div>    

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <h4>Purchase Estimate tool</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The Purchase Estimate helps you build a complete wireless solution that fits your customer's needs.</li>
        <li>We should always ask questions to understand our customers' needs and this tool takes all the information you gather and puts it in an easy-to-read format.</li>
        <li>Based on the reason for the customer's visit, you have three Purchase Estimate options:
            <ul>
                <li>Purchased</li>
                <li>Still thinking about it</li>
                <li>Already with us</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Select <b>Purchased</b> if your customer is a new subscriber to T-Mobile and signed up today.</li>
        <li><b>Still thinking about it</b> is for new customers who did not sign up today and need time to digest your recommendation.</li>
        <li><b>Already with us</b> is for our loyal T-Mobile customers interested in an account change.</li>
        <li>Based on your selection, your customer will receive a personalized Purchase Estimate, so make sure it's the right one.</li>
        <li>Let's take a tour of the Purchase Estimate!</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Walk Through Activity</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Obtain hands on experience navigating the Purchase Estimate tool.</p>

        <!--Slide 6--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199413831761931/499607553420820490/Slide6.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199413831761931/499607553420820490/Slide6.png"></a></div>

    <p>Show the Purchase Estimate tool within Customer Connect.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate MA's to log in to T-Mobile Connect</li>
        <li>MA's follow along with their REMO or computer</li>
        <li>Complete Walk Through Activity as a team</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by inputting the customer's:
            <ul>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Email</li>
                <li>Phone Number</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tap the customer's preferred language.</li>
        <li>Tap the type of Purchase Estimate from the Guide the Purchase drop-down.</li>
        <li>For this walkthrough, we will use <b>Purchased</b>.</li>
        <li>Next week you will learn the different types of Purchase Estimates and get some additional practice.</li>
        <li>The Purchase Estimate is broken up into two sections.
            <ul>
                <li>Monthly Total</li>
                <li>In-store Total</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We're going digital, the Purchase Estimate totals up the cost!</li>
        <li>Under each section, there are C2 links for additional information.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>At the end of the Purchase Estimate, include your T-Mobile email address along with your store phone number.</li>
        <li>During training you won't be using the RSM email and SAP fields, however once you are in your stores this is an important step.</li>
        <li>This information is displayed on the customer's copy of the Purchase Estimate.</li>
    </ul>

        <!--Slide 7--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199413831761931/499607569740857345/Slide7.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199413831761931/499607569740857345/Slide7.png"></a></div>

<h2>Sales Floor Activities</h2>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>We're not done learning about side-by-side selling. The fun has just begun!</p>
    <p>When your learners are out on the sales floor today, the group should be connecting the dots between what they learned in class and what they see in real life.</p>

    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>Time is allotted at the end of each day for sales floor activities. Most days will have sales floor activities from multiple modules. Before ending this module, spend a few moments scovering the instructions for this module's sales floor activities. Refer to the <a href="https://c2.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-437474">Ready! Roadmap</a> for specific timing.</p>

        <!--Slide 8--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199413831761931/499607590750126080/Slide8.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199413831761931/499607590750126080/Slide8.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Review the content on the slide with the group.</li>
        <li>Have the learners bring their <b>Sales Floor Activity Guide</b> with them and take notes as they observe and interact with the store team on the sales floor.</li>
        <li>If learners are unable to complete an activity or observe everything on the slide, additional time for sales floor activities is provided during the weekly review days. This is a good time for learners to go back through the week's activities and fill in the blanks.</li>
    </ul>
