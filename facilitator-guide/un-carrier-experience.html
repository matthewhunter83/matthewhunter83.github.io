<!--Comments and examples - Collapsible section of code

Slide example. Replace [[Image URL]] with the url for the image in both locations. Slides should be placed logically between facilitator guide elements which may mean sometimes they are inbetween two paragraphs or lists.

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=[[Image URL]]"><img class="slide" src="[[Image URL]]"></a></div>

Topic example. This creates a magenta bar separating major sections of content and matches the magenta bars on the orientation guide.

        <h2>[[Topic]]</h2>

Action example. This creates a gray bar within a topic to further separate larger sections into smaller ones and is in the left column of the page.  Actions should not be present before the first topic.

        <h3>[[Action]]</h3>

Segment Topic example.  Page 3 of the Un-carrier Experience Principles facilitator guide has a few examples of this infrequently used element with the words Customer Focus and Simplicity.  Segment Topics are not sticky so they won't cling to the top of the window on the html, but they look different than bolded text on the rendered html.

        <h4>[[Segment Topic]]</h4>

Paragraph example.  Most of the facilitator guide is written in paragraphs.  Each <p> section should only contain one paragraph with no line breaks.  Inside of paragraphs, please use the <b></b> tag for bolded text, <i></i> for italicized text, <u></u> for underlined text, and <span class="magenta"></span> for magenta text enclosing the relevant text.

        <p>[[Facilitator guide paragraph]]</p>

Unordered/Ordered list example.  These are overused in the facilitator guides and are the most time consuming to set up because they are often nested many levels, and sometimes nested within paragraphs (<p>). Here as an example of how these should look, note where the text is located in the [[Item 2]] example in relation to it's nested list:

<ul>
    <li>[[Item 1]]</li>
    <li>[[Item 2]]
        <ul>
            <li>[[Sub-item 1]]</li>
            <li>[[Sub-item 2]]</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>[[Item 3]]</li>
</ul>

Replace <ul></ul> with <ol></ol> for ordered lists, and don't worry if the type of ordering is different than what the facilitator guide shows (T-Mobile is pretty inconsistent about it's ording system). Here are some samples to copy:

        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

<h2>Intro - What is Un-Carrier?</h2>        

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This module introduces the learner to our T-Mobile culture! It starts the full day of focus on what makes        T-Mobile different from the wireless carriers. We are the Un-carrier!</p>
    <p>In this introductory module, we'll look at the T-Mobile Manifesto in a video. Then we'll talk about the T-Mobile Promise. It's that simple: We're about the customer! And last, we'll look at companies outside the wireless industry that are known for being about the customer. What are the common elements that make up world class retailers?</p>
    <p>It's critical that you communicate the excitement and strength of our Un-carrier brand to the learners. They've joined an amazing company and they need to feel it from the start!</p>

        <li>What makes that a true statement? How has mobile technology changed the world?</li>

<h2>Intro - We're About the Customer</h2>
    
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The T-Mobile Promise is how we do business. It's that simple: We're about the customer!</p>

        <!--Slide 6--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498032022791389204/499593659138834432/Slide6.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498032022791389204/499593659138834432/Slide6.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Explain</h3>  
    <p>We are changing wireless for good and it's up to every one of us to create an experience in our stores that proves that we put customers first, that we listen, and that we're not like the other carriers.</p>
    <p>We all have one goal in mind and that's to make the promise of Un-carrier real for our customers. We will bring the Un-carrier focus to the in-store experience and bring our brand to life for each customer interaction.</p>

    <h3>Ask</h3>
    <p>How do you know when that promise is realized? What does it look like in a store when they are all about the customer?</p>
    <p><i>Sample responses:</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The store feels warm and welcoming.</li>
        <li>Music playing, clear displays.</li>
        <li>The customer is greeted when they walk in.</li>
        <li>The conversation is normal and natural - not scripted.</li>
        <li>If there's a wait time, someone checks in with the customer often.</li>
        <li>Every interaction is valuable - not just the ones that make money.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>It's that simple: We are about the customer! That means we listen to our customers, and act on what we hear. In every conversation, in every sale we need to listen to the customer's needs, make that customer a priority, make the customer feel valued. It means that you <b>personally</b> own making each interaction about the customer.</p>

<h2>Highly Admired Activity</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>To consider what other well-known companies do to become a highly admired retailer. Then compare those companies to our Un-carrier Promise to be about the customer.</p>

        <!--Slide 7--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498032022791389204/499593685198045204/Slide7.png&$team_size=5"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498032022791389204/499593685198045204/Slide7.png"></a><div class="buttons"><a class="button" href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=create_teams&$user_limit=5">Create Teams</a><a class="button" href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=delete_teams">Destroy Teams</a></div></div>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>        
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the learners into teams of four or five.</li>
        <li>Read the quote from Jon Freier on the slide. Explain who Jon is if the learners don't know.</li>
        <li>Tell the teams to come up with five companies that provide an exhilarating customer experience. Retail preferred but not required.</li>
        <li>They must have three traits that demonstrate why that company is all about the customer. What makes them highly admired?</li>
        <li>Allow 15 minutes for team discussion.</li>
        <li>Ask each team to present one of their companies and their three defining traits.</li>
        <li>No company can be used twice. It the first team talks about company A, no other team can use company A as their example.</li>
    </ol>

        <!--Slide 8--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498032022791389204/499593697525235722/Slide8.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498032022791389204/499593697525235722/Slide8.png"></a></div>
    
    <h3>Debrief</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Did you hear several of your companies mentioned by other teams? What does that tell you about that company's reputation? (That will indicate that the company has a broad reputation for providing a quality customer experience.)</li>
        <li>What traits were mentioned often?</li>
        <li>How do those companies' traits compare to what you know about the Un-carrier?</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>    

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Summarize what Un-carrier means to each person.</p>
    
        <!--Slide 9--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498032022791389204/499593726310744074/Slide9.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498032022791389204/499593726310744074/Slide9.png"></a></div>
        
    <h3>Ask</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Being the Un-carrier is a company mission. But it's a personal misson, too. Of the things you've heard in this module, what resonates with you most? Did you hear something that will change your thinking or change your behavior?</li>
        <li>Ask several people to share their thoughts about the Un-carrier Experience.</li>
        <li>End the module.</li>
    </ul>
