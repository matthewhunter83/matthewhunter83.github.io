          <p>This module introduces the learner to our T-Mobile culture! It starts the full day of focus on what makes T-Mobile different from the wireless carriers. We are the Un- carrier!</p>
          <p>In this introductory module, we’ll look at the T-Mobile Manifesto in a video. Then we’ll talk about the T-Mobile Promise. It’s that simple: We’re about the customer! And last, we’ll look at companies outside the wireless industry that are known for being about the customer. What are the common elements that make up world class retailers?</p>
          <p>It’s critical that you communicate the excitement and strength of our Un-carrier brand to the learners. They’ve joined an amazing company and they need to feel it from the start!</p>

          <p>We are changing wireless for good and it’s up to every one of us to create an experience in our stores that proves that we put our customers first, that we listen, and that we’re not like the other carriers.</p>
          <p>We all have one goal in mind and that’s to make the promise of Un-carrier real for our customers. We will bring the Un-carrier focus to the in-store experience and bring our brand to life for each customer interaction.</p>

            <li>The store feels warm and welcoming.</li>
            <li>Music playing, clear displays.</li>
            <li>The customer is greeted when they walk in.</li>
            <li>The conversation is normal and natural - not scripted.</li>
            <li>If there’s a wait time, someone checks in with the customer often.</li>

          <p>It’s that simple: We are about the customer! That means we listen to our customers, and act on what we hear.
