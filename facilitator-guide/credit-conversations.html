          <p>Introduce the impact that a customer’s credit history has on offer eligibility, deposits and down payments. Discuss the importance of having a credit conversation early so that Mobile Associates (MAs) can speak accurately about offers and pricing.</p>
          <p>After successfully completing this module, learners will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Define the importance of a credit check early in a sales conversation.</li>
            <li>Explain how offers may differ based on a customer’s credit history.</li>
            <li>Practice tactfully suggesting a credit check early in a sales conversation.</li>

        <div class="list-group-item">
          <ul>
            <li>A customer’s credit history will determine if they are considered “well- qualified” or “less-qualified”.</li>
            <li>Well-qualified customers typically qualify for offers that allow them to finance more and pay less out of pocket, upfront.</li>
            <li>Less-qualified customers will usually be required to pay a larger down payment for devices and accessories, if they are choosing to finance through our equipment installment plan.</li>
            <li>It’s important to note that overall device and accessory pricing is the same, regardless of credit history.</li>
            <li>Credit can also determine if a customer is required to pay a deposit to activate service with T-Mobile.</li>
            <li>Knowing the impact of credit history, it’s a good idea to have the credit conversation early, so you can set accurate expectations on offers and out-of- pocket cost at the point of sale.</li>
            <li>Credit history can be a sensitive subject for some.</li>
            <li>Never make assumptions about what a customer will qualify for.</li>
            <li>Be polite, tactful, and transparent when requesting to check a customer’s credit.</li>
            <li>Running a credit check mostly applies to new customers. For existing customers, you’ll be able to see their credit eligibility in QuikView or Tapestry.</li>
            <li>Either way, attempt to determine early in a sales conversation what offers are available to a customer by running a credit check or checking their account in QuikView or Tapestry.</li>

          <p>What’s the risk of spending time understanding a customer’s needs, make a recommendation, and then check their credit?</p>
          <p>Possible answers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The customer may feel like they were misled if they find out they are required to pay a large down payment for the device they wanted.</li>
            <li>The customer may have been really excited about the new device and service they think they’re about to get, only to feel disappointed to have to select something different that fits their budget.</li>
            <li>Customer may leave without buying if they aren’t able to get the offer they thought they were going to get.</li>
