<!--Comments and examples - Collapsible section of code

Slide example. Replace [[Image URL]] with the url for the image in both locations. Slides should be placed logically between facilitator guide elements which may mean sometimes they are inbetween two paragraphs or lists.

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=[[Image URL]]"><img class="slide" src="[[Image URL]]"></a></div>

Topic example. This creates a magenta bar separating major sections of content and matches the magenta bars on the orientation guide.

        <h2>[[Topic]]</h2>

Action example. This creates a gray bar within a topic to further separate larger sections into smaller ones and is in the left column of the page.  Actions should not be present before the first topic.

        <h3>[[Action]]</h3>

Segment Topic example.  Page 3 of the Un-carrier Experience Principles facilitator guide has a few examples of this infrequently used element with the words Customer Focus and Simplicity.  Segment Topics are not sticky so they won't cling to the top of the window on the html, but they look different than bolded text on the rendered html.

        <h4>[[Segment Topic]]</h4>

Paragraph example.  Most of the facilitator guide is written in paragraphs.  Each <p> section should only contain one paragraph with no line breaks.  Inside of paragraphs, please use the <b></b> tag for bolded text, <i></i> for italicized text, <u></u> for underlined text, and <span class="magenta"></span> for magenta text enclosing the relevant text.

        <p>[[Facilitator guide paragraph]]</p>

Unordered/Ordered list example.  These are overused in the facilitator guides and are the most time consuming to set up because they are often nested many levels, and sometimes nested within paragraphs (<p>). Here as an example of how these should look, note where the text is located in the [[Item 2]] example in relation to it's nested list:

<ul>
    <li>[[Item 1]]</li>
    <li>[[Item 2]]
        <ul>
            <li>[[Sub-item 1]]</li>
            <li>[[Sub-item 2]]</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>[[Item 3]]</li>
</ul>

Replace <ul></ul> with <ol></ol> for ordered lists, and don't worry if the type of ordering is different than what the facilitator guide shows (T-Mobile is pretty inconsistent about it's ording system). Here are some samples to copy:

        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199619029958688/499608514239660042/Slide3.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199619029958688/499608514239660042/Slide3.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>Explain the following in your own words:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the last module, we learned about how our network works and how we speak <b>UFC</b> with our customers.</li>
        <li>Today, we'll make it personal for our customers by making sure they know exactly how we've got them covered.</li>
        <li>But first let's see what you remember from Network Part 1!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>Ask learners to throw out facts that they learned from Network Part 1 without referencing their notes.</p>
    <p>If participation is low, throw out some questions to check for understanding:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What does UFC stand for? <i>Unlimited Fast Coverage</i></li>
        <li>What do we have to back up our network claims? <i>Serious data! From OpenSignal, SpeedTest.net, and the FCC.</i></li>
        <li>What are some things we have done recently to invest in our network? <i>Purchased spectrum. Covered new areas. Upgraded old technology.</i></li>
        <li>How does our newest network technology benefit customers? <i>Better in-building coverage. Faster. More coverage (especially rural).</i></li>
        <li>How many millions of people do we cover? <i>322 million</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>Now that we have our network knowledge locked in, let's bring it to life for our customers!</p>

<h2>DIY Activity</h2>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p><b>Timing: 30 min DIY activity, 15 min debrief.</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mobile Associates should spend equal time exploring the coverage maps and researching supplemental coverage solutions.
            <ul>
                <li>Read about coverage maps
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://c2.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-415024">Coverage Map</a></li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Explore coverage maps</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/coverage-map">Coverage Map</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/lte-comparison-map">LTE Comparison Map</a></li>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For the coverage map, make sure learners walk away from that part of the activity comfortable enough with how it works to skill practice while using it.</li>
        <li>For the coverage solutions, make sure learners stay focused on the question "who is this a good fit for" and not so much on the technical details.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Split class into groups of three or less.</li>
        <li>One learner plays the part of the Mobile Expert performing a personal coverage check, another learner plays themselves providing addresses (or zip codes) for where they live, work, and play.</li>

        <li>Rotate roles until each learner has the chance to play the part of the Mobile Expert.</li>
        <li>Tie the activity back to part 1 of the module, where we learned how to position our network.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>How easy was it for you to speak confidently about our network?</li>
        <li>What was the most difficult part of the conversation for you?</li>
        <li>When should you offer to check coverage for a customer?
            <ul>
                <li>Any time it is relevant to the conversation.</li>
                <li>Especially if a customer is switching to T-Mobile.</li>

                <li>Expectations don't match reality -- possible future frustration.</li>
                <li>Lost opportunity to provide a solution.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

<h2>Sales Floor Activities</h2>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>We're not done learning about our network. The fun has just begun!</p>
    <p>When your learners are out on the sales floor today, the group should be connecting the dots between what they learned in class and what they see in real life.</p>

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199619029958688/499608643742728203/Slide8.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199619029958688/499608643742728203/Slide8.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Review the content on the slide with the group.</li>
        <li>Have the learners bring their <b>Sales Floor Activities</b> packet with them and take notes as they observe and interact with the store team on the sales floor.</li>
        <li>If learners are unable to complete an activity or observe everything on the slide, additional time for sales floor activities is provided during the weekly review days. This is a good time for learners to go back through the week's activities and fill in the blanks.</li>
    </ul>
