<!--Comments and examples - Collapsible section of code

Slide example. Replace [[Image URL]] with the url for the image in both locations. Slides should be placed logically between facilitator guide elements which may mean sometimes they are inbetween two paragraphs or lists.

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=[[Image URL]]"><img class="slide" src="[[Image URL]]"></a></div>

Topic example. This creates a magenta bar separating major sections of content and matches the magenta bars on the orientation guide.

        <h2>[[Topic]]</h2>

Action example. This creates a gray bar within a topic to further separate larger sections into smaller ones and is in the left column of the page.  Actions should not be present before the first topic.

        <h3>[[Action]]</h3>

Segment Topic example.  Page 3 of the Un-carrier Experience Principles facilitator guide has a few examples of this infrequently used element with the words Customer Focus and Simplicity.  Segment Topics are not sticky so they won't cling to the top of the window on the html, but they look different than bolded text on the rendered html.

        <h4>[[Segment Topic]]</h4>

Paragraph example.  Most of the facilitator guide is written in paragraphs.  Each <p> section should only contain one paragraph with no line breaks.  Inside of paragraphs, please use the <b></b> tag for bolded text, <i></i> for italicized text, <u></u> for underlined text, and <span class="magenta"></span> for magenta text enclosing the relevant text.

        <p>[[Facilitator guide paragraph]]</p>

Unordered/Ordered list example.  These are overused in the facilitator guides and are the most time consuming to set up because they are often nested many levels, and sometimes nested within paragraphs (<p>). Here as an example of how these should look, note where the text is located in the [[Item 2]] example in relation to it's nested list:

<ul>
    <li>[[Item 1]]</li>
    <li>[[Item 2]]
        <ul>
            <li>[[Sub-item 1]]</li>
            <li>[[Sub-item 2]]</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>[[Item 3]]</li>
</ul>

Replace <ul></ul> with <ol></ol> for ordered lists, and don't worry if the type of ordering is different than what the facilitator guide shows (T-Mobile is pretty inconsistent about it's ording system). Here are some samples to copy:

        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

<h2>Intro</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Introduce learners to the T-Mobile values of How We Play.</p>

        <!--Slide 2--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199276191744023/499594039943888906/Slide2.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199276191744023/499594039943888906/Slide2.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>Explain the following in your own words:</p>
    <p>How We Play is the name for T-Mobile values. Values are the actions we take to make sure we are working according to our Principles. The How We Play values also show us how to work with each other, not just external customers. It's how we work together to become a highly admired retailer and how we have become a best place to work.</p>

        <!--Slide 3--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199276191744023/499594077353017364/Slide3.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199276191744023/499594077353017364/Slide3.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>We've learned about Principles and now about values. Values are the behaviors that make the Principles real. How do they work together?</p>
    
            <p>Read out each value including the supporting sentence. Ask questions as needed during the read out.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Frontline first because our customers are first.</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We value our frontline teams because they take care of our customers.</li>

                </li>
                <li><b>Be bold. Think big. Make a difference.</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We have a fearless mindset. We are here to change the industry. We take the right risks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Play to WIN and have fun.</b>

                    <li>We are here to win and have some fun along the way.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><b>Do it the right way.</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>We earn the trust of our team mates, customers, and shareholders every day.</li>
                </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p><b>Principles and Values Work Together</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask learners which Principle the values behaviors support.</li>
        <li>Accept any reasonable answer but here are some suggestions. There are a lot of right answers!
            <ul>
                <li>Customer Focus = Front line first, because customers are first.</li>
                <li>Serious Fun = Play to WIN and have fun.</li>
                <li>Simplicity = Results matter. Count on me to deliver. (authentic experience)</li>
                <li>Freedom = Be bold. Think big. Make a difference.</li>
                <li>Customer Focus = Do it the right way.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

<h2>What People Say</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>To point out how broken the wireless industry is and how the Un-carrier Experience at T-Mobile makes us different. We're about the customer.</p>
    
    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>It's that simple: We are about the customer! That means we listen to our customers... and what they've got to say about wireless carriers isn't pretty. We've heard John Legere call wireless "a stupid, broken, arrogant industry." In this next video, we'll hear how actual customers feel about wireless.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p><b>What Do Real Customers Think?</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Show the <a href="https://c2.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-421531">Industry Sentiment Video.</a></li>
        <li>Show the debrief slide.</li>
        <li>Ask the learners the following question.
            <ul>
                <li>How did these customers describe the carriers and the wireless industry?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tell the learners that this is a major differentiator for us. Our values make us not like the others. In every sale, in every conversation we need to be about the customer. We listen to the customer's needs, make the customer a priority, make the customer feel valued. The opposite of what we hear in the video.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>What People Say, Part II</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>To contrast what people say about T-Mobile with the other carriers we just heard about.</p>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p><b>What Customers Say About Us</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Every customer should have an Un-carrier experience, ever time, on the phone and in the store. We want a relationship with each of our customers where they understand that we are the Un-carrier and how that benefits them.</li>
        <li>You own the customer interaction and it's your responsibility to create that relationship. That sounds great but what does it look like in real life?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Tell the learners that the quotes they are about to see are taken from actual customer letters.</li>
        <li>Play the <a href="https://c2.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-421527">Customer Letters video</a>.</li> Make sure learners know how to pay close attention - this video is really quick!
    </ol>

<h2>Bring It Together Activity</h2>

        <!--Slide 8--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199276191744023/499594152670134272/Slide8.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199276191744023/499594152670134272/Slide8.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Debrief</h3>
    <p>Ask the following debrief questions. Add your own as the discussion requires.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How were these comments different than those we heard from the other carrier's customers?</li>
        <li>Which How We Play values showed up in the customer comments?</li>
        <li>How did customers feel about their T-Mobile "person?"</li>
        <li>If you had to pick only one value for T-Mobile to demonstrate which one would it be and why?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: Some things to point out if the learners don't mention them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Many included the name of their T-Mobile person.</li>
        <li>They had routine transactions but the employee made a big impression.</li>
        <li>They made a commitment to stay with T-Mobile.</li>
        <li>They were blunt when comparing T-Mobile to their old carrier.</li>
    </ul>

        <!--Slide 9--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199276191744023/499594162090278914/Slide9.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199276191744023/499594162090278914/Slide9.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Explain</h3>  
    <p>In your own words, close this module by making these points.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Earlier we heard customers say that they don't feel like carriers are listening. We are! We find out what's broken in wireless for our customers and then we let the customer know they can count on us to deliver.</li>
        <li>You are the owner of the Un-carrier experience for every customer that you interact with every day.</li>
        <li>It's up to you to deliver on our values whether you're resolving an issue, selling a device, or imply talking to the customer. It's the Un-carrier Experience that makes us a highly admired retail organization!</li>
    </ul>
