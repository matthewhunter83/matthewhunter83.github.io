<!--Comments and examples - Collapsible section of code

Slide example. Replace [[Image URL]] with the url for the image in both locations. Slides should be placed logically between facilitator guide elements which may mean sometimes they are inbetween two paragraphs or lists.

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=[[Image URL]]"><img class="slide" src="[[Image URL]]"></a></div>

Topic example. This creates a magenta bar separating major sections of content and matches the magenta bars on the orientation guide.

        <h2>[[Topic]]</h2>

Action example. This creates a gray bar within a topic to further separate larger sections into smaller ones and is in the left column of the page.  Actions should not be present before the first topic.

        <h3>[[Action]]</h3>

Segment Topic example.  Page 3 of the Un-carrier Experience Principles facilitator guide has a few examples of this infrequently used element with the words Customer Focus and Simplicity.  Segment Topics are not sticky so they won't cling to the top of the window on the html, but they look different than bolded text on the rendered html.

        <h4>[[Segment Topic]]</h4>

Paragraph example.  Most of the facilitator guide is written in paragraphs.  Each <p> section should only contain one paragraph with no line breaks.  Inside of paragraphs, please use the <b></b> tag for bolded text, <i></i> for italicized text, <u></u> for underlined text, and <span class="magenta"></span> for magenta text enclosing the relevant text.

        <p>[[Facilitator guide paragraph]]</p>

Unordered/Ordered list example.  These are overused in the facilitator guides and are the most time consuming to set up because they are often nested many levels, and sometimes nested within paragraphs (<p>). Here as an example of how these should look, note where the text is located in the [[Item 2]] example in relation to it's nested list:

<ul>
    <li>[[Item 1]]</li>
    <li>[[Item 2]]
        <ul>
            <li>[[Sub-item 1]]</li>
            <li>[[Sub-item 2]]</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>[[Item 3]]</li>
</ul>

Replace <ul></ul> with <ol></ol> for ordered lists, and don't worry if the type of ordering is different than what the facilitator guide shows (T-Mobile is pretty inconsistent about it's ording system). Here are some samples to copy:

        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

<h2>Intro</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The introduction will enable Mobile Associates to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recognize T-Mobile's serious investment in our network.</li>
        <li>Express high-level network positioning.</li>
    </ul>

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199567511322624/499608104564949003/Slide3.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199567511322624/499608104564949003/Slide3.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Ask</h3>
    <p>Find out what the group's perception of our network is like. Encourage honest answers. Try something like: Ok, give it to me straight -- what have you heard about T-Mobile's network? Good and bad.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What do your friends think?</li>
        <li>What have you read online?</li>
        <li>What's your perception?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>Explain the following in your own words:</p>
    <p><b>Let's Get Grounded</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Our network has totally transformed over time.</li>
        <li>Old perceptions die hard -- our network may still be a reservation for customers, so you gotta know your stuff and truly own our network.</li>
        <li>The reality -- it wasn't always this way, but today we're #1. Seriously!</li>
        <li>Any carrier can claim their network is the best, but we have <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/content/t-mobile/corporate/news/articles/2018/07/ookla-opensignal-2018.html">serious data</a> to back it up.</li>
        <li>How'd we get here? Because our investment in our network over the past few years has been off the charts.</li>
        <li>Our massive network growth is largely based on cutting-edge network technology.</li>
        <li>Customers need a device that can "see" the latest network signals to take full advantage of our network.</li>
        <li>Saying "your coverage will be better with a new device" sounds bogus to customers! So when you need to have that conversation with a customer, we'll make sure you're ready to back up the claim with facts and evidence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Explain the following in your own words:</p>
    <p><b>Let's Talk About It</b></p>
    <p>We get it. Talking about our network can be a little intimidating. When you speak:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You gotta know your stuff.</li>
        <li>You gotta have proof.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Owning your network is a huge part of Explore & Discover! To help you stay on track, we've turned the facts and talking points into an easy to remember rallying cry -- Our network is <b>UFC</b>: Unlimited. Fast. Coverage.</p>

    <h3>Action</h3>
    <p>Enough listening: Let's talk network! Choose three learners to read aloud the next three slides. Keep the energy high -- this is exciting stuff!</p>
    <h4>UNLIMITED: Never worry about how much data you use ever again!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Only T-Mobile's 4G LTE network can handle unlimited everything.</li>
        <li>Verizon built their network when phones were just used for calls.</li>
        <li>Carriers trick you into spending more and sharing data.</li>
        <li>With T-Mobile, use whatever you want without worry.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>FAST: We have the nation's fastest 4G LTE network.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Everyone claims fastest, but we've got the<b>proof</b>.
        <ul>
            <li>OpenSignal, SpeedTest.net, and the FCC say so.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>We have more towers and spectrum per customer than Verizon or AT&T.
            <ul>
                <li>That means less congestion and faster speeds!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>COVERAGE: T-Mobile's 4G LTE coverage has nearly tripled since 2015. We now reach 98% of people with LTE.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>We cover 322 million people, nearly every single American.</li>
        <li>Only T-Mobile offers extra coverage solutions that go beyond cellular.</li>
        <li>We. Won't. Stop. ...building our network every day!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Debrief</h3>
    <p>See the slide titled <b>The Download</b>. Here are some ideas to check for understanding. Feel free to add your own!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What have we recently done to invest in our network?
            <ul>
                <li>Purchased spectrum.</li>
                <li>Rolled out coverage in new areas.</li>
                <li>Transformed older network technology into newer (2G into 4G LTE).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What's the difference between high, mid and low band spectrum?
            <ul>
                <li>High band: high capacity, low reach</li>
                <li>Mid band: balanced capacity and reach (foundation of our network)</li>
                <li>Low band: low capacity, high reach (penetrates buildings)</li>
                <li>T-Mobile is primarily mid band with a low band overlay.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What must a device support to "see" our newer network signals?
            <ul>
                <li>600 MHz/Band 71</li>
                <li>700 MHz/Band 12</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What do we call our latest network technology? Do customers care?
            <ul>
                <li>4G LTE/Extended Range LTE (ERLTE).</li>
                <li>Most customers only care about the benefits!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>How does our newest network technology benefit customers?
            <ul>
                <li>Better in-building coverage.</li>
                <li>Faster speeds.</li>
                <li>More coverage (especially rural areas).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Sales Floor Activities</h2>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>We're not done learning about our network. The fun has just begun!</p>
    <p>When your learners are out on the sales floor today, the group should be connecting the dots between what they learned in class and what they see in real life.</p>

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Time is allotted at the end of each day for sales floor activities. Most days will have sales floor activities from multiple modules. Before ending this module, spend a few moments covering the instructions for this module's sales floor activities. Refer to the <a href="https://c2.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-437474">Ready! Roadmap</a> for specific timing.</p>

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199567511322624/499608360295989249/Slide10.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199567511322624/499608360295989249/Slide10.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Review the content on the slide with the group.</li>
        <li>Have the learners bring their <b>Sales Floor Activity Guide</b> with them and take notes as they observe and interact with the store team on the sales floor.</li>
        <li>If learners are unable to complete an activity or observe everything on the slide, additional time for sales floor activities is provided during the weekly review days. This is a good time for learners to go back through the week's activities and fill in the blanks.</li>
    </ul>
