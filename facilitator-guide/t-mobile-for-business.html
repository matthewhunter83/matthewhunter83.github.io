          <ul>
            <li>A small business is defined as having less than 100 employees. </li>
            <li>They have a huge impact on the economy. </li>
            <li>They employ over half of all private sector employees. </li>
            <li>They hire over 40% of high tech workers such as scientists, engineers, and programmers.</li>
            <li>Here’s the best or worst news. Today, most of those small businesses aren’t taking advantage of the benefits of T-Mobile. </li>
            <li>That means there are tons of opportunities for you to rescue these customers from ATT and Verizon.</li>
            <li>Working with a T-Mobile for Business customer is a great opportunity for multiple line sales and a strong ongoing relationship with that business owner.</li>
            <li>Often that owner knows others in their industry, they become a great source of referral leads.</li>

          <ul>

                <li>Sample Answer: Unlimited data and texting for free when he’s traveling. He can make Wi-Fi calls back to his business for free. He can make calls from the US for only .20 cents a minute. These benefits make the cost of
                  international business easy, affordable and hassle free.</li>
