          <p><strong>Scenario 1: Tom</strong></p>
          <p>Solution should be to empathize with Tom and check the amount of free memory. If below 150 MB, free up some memory by reviewing applications, photos, and videos to determine which ones Tom would like to remove. Known issues: Samsung J7 Prime (<a href="https://c2.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-431199">431199</a>)</p>
          <p><strong>Scenario 2: Martha</strong></p>
          <p>Solution should be to apologize for the issue and let Martha know we’re working with Apple to resolve this as quickly as possible. On the customers iPhone, open the Phone app and tap on Voicemail. At the top left, tap Greeting, then tap Cancel. They should now see the messages and be able to play them. Known issues: iPhone X (<a href="https://c2.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-435659">435659</a>)</p>
          <p><strong>Scenario 3: Elvis</strong></p>
          <p>Solution should be to empathize with Elvis and explain the QuikButton key on the right side of the tablet. The QuickButton key toggles the display between full color and grayscale. To revert to full color from grayscale, simple press the QuickButton key again. Known issues: LG GPad X2 8.0 Plus (<a href="https://c2.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-437171">437171</a>)</p>
