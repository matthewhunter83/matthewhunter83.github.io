          <p>A Principle is a fundamental truth that serves as the foundation for your behavior. T-Mobile has five Principles that influence every decision we make. They guide us to the right decisions to make sure we deliver on our Un-carrier promise.</p>
          <p>Tell learners to take notes in their Participant Guide during this discussion as they’ll be using the information later in the day. They can also download the Principles from C2 (<a href="https://c2.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-423276">423276</a>).</p>

        <div class="list-group-item">
          <p><strong>Customer Focus</strong></p>
          <p>Read the Customer Focus Principle on the slide. Discuss the following questions with the learners. Add your own questions as the discussion requires.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask the learners why Customer Focus in our first Principle.</li>
            <li>Whether you’re new or existing, we put our customers first. That’s kind of an odd statement. In a typical wireless retail store what happens if you’re an existing customer?</li>
            <li>If you are living this Principle in your store, what is your responsibility?
              <ul>
                <li>Sample Answers
                  <ul>
                    <li>To be as committed to helping the customer with a problem as you are to the customer who wants to buy something.</li>
                    <li>Helping customers comes before stocking or inventory or paperwork.</li>
                    <li>Be respectful of the customer’s time. Spend time on what matters to them.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Treat all customers, regardless of who they are or why they’re in the store with the same focus: We’re about the customer. All customers!</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>
          <p>Read the Simplicity Principle from the slide. Discuss the following questions with the learners.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Given what you know about T-Mobile, why is Simplicity considered a foundational behavior?</li>
            <li>How will Simplicity show up in our products and services?</li>
            <li>
              If you are living the Simplicity Principle, how will it show up in your customer interactions?
              <ul>
                <li>Sample answers:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Be your true authentic self with the customer. Don’t be that "typical" sales person.</li>
                    <li>Be honest about the products and services.</li>
                    <li>Keep your sales discussions simple and straightforward. Don’t use industry jargon.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Simple, honest and transparent actions will set T-Mobile above the other wireless carriers and keep your customers coming back.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Value</strong></p>
          <p>Read the Value Principle from the slide. Discuss the following questions with the learners.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What do you think of when you hear the word value?</li>
            <li>How does T-Mobile provide value to our customers?</li>
            <li>How do you, the frontline face of T-Mobile, provide value for your customers?
              <ul>
                <li>Sample answers:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Recommend what the customer really needs, not what you’ll make the most commission on.</li>
                    <li>Tell them about the additional services and products that will help them get the most out of their wireless service. Ex. screen protectors.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Freedom</strong></p>
          <p>Read the Freedom Principle from the slide. Discuss the following questions with the learners.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We heard a quote earlier about the mobile device being the single greatest technology invention of our life. How does mobility give us freedom?</li>
            <li>T-Mobile has plans that include unlimited calls, text, and data. How does that free the customer to use their devices however they want?</li>
            <li>In living this Principle, how do you break down barriers for your customer?
              <ul>
                <li>Sample answers:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Really listening to what they need and making sure you get it for them.</li>
                    <li>Help them freely explore the store and our devices.</li>
                    <li>Tell customers about the value of T-Mobile beyond just free stuff: customer service, multiple ways to connect with you, their T-Mobile person.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Honestly, you are the biggest value the customer receives from T- Mobile. T-Mobile’s right priced products, rate plans and services, plus your personalized attention to their wireless needs gives your customer full value for their money.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Serious Fun</strong></p>
          <p>Read the Principle from the slide. Discuss the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Serious fun! Seriously? That sounds like a contradiction. What is your take on this Principle?</li>
            <li>How does Serious Fun show up in our stores?</li>
            <li>This Principle is one that everyone embraces. How will you have Serious Fun with your customers?
              <ul>
                <li>Sample answers:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Be natural and at ease with them.</li>
                    <li>Don’t be afraid to be personal. Share how you use wireless and what works for you.</li>
                    <li>Be genuinely interested in them as a person, not just another sale.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Just remember to follow your customer’s lead on what serious fun looks like!</li>
          </ul>

        <p class="list-group-item">Debrief</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-9">
        <div class="list-group-item">
          <p>There are two ways you can do this debrief. Choose the one that suits you and your class best.</p>
          <p><strong>Option 1: Free for all</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask how many people saw all 5 Principles in action. Tell learners that if they didn’t see all five, take notes on what the other learners saw.</li>
            <li>Ask for volunteers to tell you the most exciting Principle they saw in action and the impact it had on the customer or the employee or the company.</li>
            <li>Make sure all the Principles are covered and each person has responded at least twice. Call on the learners if necessary.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Option 2: Sequential order</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask how many people saw all 5 Principles in action. Tell learners that if they didn’t see all five, take notes on what the other learners saw.</li>
            <li>Call out each Principle individually. Ask for two or three volunteers to share what they saw and the impact of that Principle.</li>
            <li>Make sure all learners contribute at least one Principle and the impact.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Then, ask the following questions:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>How do the Un-carrier Principles change the store environment? How is it different from a typical retail store?
              <p>Sample Answers:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>All customers are a priority, regardless of their reasons for visiting.</li>
                <li>We make things simple and are transparent.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>How do the Principles tie into the Un-carrier brand?
              <p>Sample Answers:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>They influence every decision we make.</li>
                <li>They guide us to the right decisions to make sure we deliver on our Un-carrier promise.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What makes it challenging to live up these Principles?
              <p>Sample Answers:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Other tasks</li>
                <li>Difficult situations</li>
                <li>Busy store</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Which Principle resonates most with you, and why?</li>
