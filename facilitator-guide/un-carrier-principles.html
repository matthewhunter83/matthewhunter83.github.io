        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=image_url?"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199233028030464/499593874805751808/Slide3.png"></a></div>
        <h3>Explain</h3>
        <p>A Principle is a fundamental truth that serves as the foundation for your behavior. T-Mobile has five Principles that influence every decision we make. They guide us to the right decisions to make sure we deliver on our Un-carrier promise.</p>
        <p>Tell learners to take notes in their Participant Guide during this discussion as they’ll be using the information later in the day. They can also download the <a href="https://c2.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-423276">Principles</a> from C2.</p>
        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=image_url?"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199233028030464/499593903285076008/Slide4.png"></a></div>
        <h3>Ask</h3>
        <h4>Customer Focus</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Read the Customer Focus Principle on the slide. Discuss the following questions with the learners. Add your own questions as the discussion requires.</li>
            <li>Ask the learners why Customer Focus in our first Principle.</li>
            <li>Whether you’re new or existing, we put our customers first. That’s kind of an odd statement. In a typical wireless retail store what happens if you’re an existing customer?</li>
            <li>If you are living this Principle in your store, what is your responsibility?
                <ul>
                    <li>Sample answers:
                        <ul>
                            <li>To be as committed to helping the customer with a problem as you are to the customer who wants to buy something.</li>
                            <li>Helping customers comes before stocking or inventory or paperwork.</li>
                            <li>Be respectful of the customer’s time. Spend time on what matters to them.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Treat all customers, regardless of who they are or why they’re in the store with the same focus: We’re about the customer. All customers!</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Simplicity</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Read the Simplicity Principle from the slide. Discuss the following questions with the learners.
                <ul>
                    <li>Given what you know about T-Mobile, why is Simplicity considered a foundational behavior?</li>
                    <li>How will Simplicity show up in our products and services?</li>
                    <li>If you are living the Simplicity Principle, how will it show up in your customer interactions?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sample answers:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Be your true authentic self with the customer. Don’t be that "typical" sales person.</li>
                                    <li>Be honest about the products and services.</li>
                                    <li>Keep your sales discussions simple and straightforward. Don’t use industry jargon.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Simple, honest and transparent actions will set T-Mobile above the other wireless carriers and keep your customers coming back.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Value</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Read the Value Principle from the slide. Discuss the following questions with the learners. <ul>
                    <li>What do you think of when you hear the word value?</li>
                    <li>How does T-Mobile provide value to our customers?</li>
                    <li>How do you, the frontline face of T-Mobile, provide value for your customers?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sample answers:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Recommend what the customer really needs, not what you’ll make the most commission on.</li>
                                    <li>Tell them about the additional services and products that will help them get the most out of their wireless service. Ex. screen protectors.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Freedom</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Read the Freedom Principle from the slide. Discuss the following questions with the learners. <ul>
                    <li>We heard a quote earlier about the mobile device being the single greatest technology invention of our life. How does mobility give us freedom?</li>
                    <li>T-Mobile has plans that include unlimited calls, text, and data. How does that free the customer to use their devices however they want?</li>
                    <li>In living this Principle, how do you break down barriers for your customer? <ul>
                            <li>Sample answers:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Really listening to what they need and making sure you get it for them.</li>
                                    <li>Help them freely explore the store and our devices.</li>
                                    <li>Tell customers about the value of T-Mobile beyond just free stuff: customer service, multiple ways to connect with you, their T-Mobile person.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Honestly, you are the biggest value the customer receives from T- Mobile. T-Mobile’s right priced products, rate plans and services, plus your personalized attention to their wireless needs gives your customer full value for their money.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Serious Fun</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Read the Principle from the slide. Discuss the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Serious fun! Seriously? That sounds like a contradiction. What is your take on this Principle?</li>
                    <li>How does Serious Fun show up in our stores?</li>
                    <li>This Principle is one that everyone embraces. How will you have Serious Fun with your customers?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sample answers:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Be natural and at ease with them.</li>
                                    <li>Don’t be afraid to be personal. Share how you use wireless and what works for you.</li>
                                    <li>Be genuinely interested in them as a person, not just another sale.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Just remember to follow your customer’s lead on what serious fun looks like!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sales Floor Activities Debrief</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>To hear what the learners discovered on their sales floor time. Encourage discussion and exchange of ideas and observations.</p>
        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=image_url?"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199233028030464/499593929109405696/Slide6.png"></a></div>
        <h3>Debrief</h3>
        <p>There are two ways you can do this debrief. Choose the one that suits you and your class best.</p>
        <h4>Option 1: Free for all</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ask how many people saw all 5 Principles in action. Tell learners that if they didn’t see all five, take notes on what the other learners saw.</li>
            <li>Ask for volunteers to tell you the most exciting Principle they saw in action and the impact it had on the customer or the employee or the company.</li>
            <li>Make sure all the Principles are covered and each person has responded at least twice. Call on the learners if necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Option 2: Sequential order</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ask how many people saw all 5 Principles in action. Tell learners that if they didn’t see all five, take notes on what the other learners saw.</li>
            <li>Call out each Principle individually. Ask for two or three volunteers to share what they saw and the impact of that Principle.</li>
            <li>Make sure all learners contribute at least one Principle and the impact.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Then, ask the following questions:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>How do the Un-carrier Principles change the store environment? How is it different from a typical retail store?</li>
            <li>How do the Principles tie into the Un-carrier brand?</li>
            <li>What makes it challenging to live up these Principles?</li>
            <li>Which Principle resonates most with you, and why?</li>
        </ul>
