            <li>Clearly, phones are EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li>Nothing about wireless service is more exciting than a new phone.</li>
            <li>Phones contain our memories.</li>
            <li>They bring the awesomeness of our network to life.</li>
            <li>They are our connection to the world.</li>
            <li>Because of this, phones are very personal.</li>
            <li>Customers will look to you as the expert to help them find the right phone, that fits their budget.</li>
            <li>It’s important to be able to make recommendations without personal bias towards a brand or operating system.</li>
            <li>Phones have super-advanced technology, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the terminology used to describe a phone’s awesomeness can sound like a foreign language to customers.</li>
            <li>As the MA, you’re there to translate those specs into meaningful benefits for the customer.</li>
            <li>Pretend the customer asked, “Why does that matter?”</li>
            <li>For sales purposes, we have two categories of handsets – Superphones and Smartpicks.</li>
            <li>Superphones tend to be the flagship devices that have their own commercials and marketing, and are more expensive.</li>
            <li>Smartpicks are the devices that are still feature-packed, often with a lot of the same features as the superphones, but at a more affordable price.</li>
