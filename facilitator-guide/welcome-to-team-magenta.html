Slide example. Replace [[Image URL]] with the url for the image in both locations. Slides should be placed logically between facilitator guide elements which may mean sometimes they are inbetween two paragraphs or lists.

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=[[Image URL]]"><img class="slide" src="[[Image URL]]"></a></div>

Topic example. This creates a magenta bar separating major sections of content and matches the magenta bars on the orientation guide.

        <h2>[[Topic]]</h2>

Action example. This creates a gray bar within a topic to further separate larger sections into smaller ones and is in the left column of the page.  Actions should not be present before the first topic.

        <h3>[[Action]]</h3>

Segment Topic example.  Page 3 of the Un-carrier Experience Principles facilitator guide has a few examples of this infrequently used element with the words Customer Focus and Simplicity.  Segment Topics are not sticky so they won't cling to the top of the window on the html, but they look different than bolded text on the rendered html.

        <h4>[[Segment Topic]]</h4>

Paragraph example.  Most of the facilitator guide is written in paragraphs.  Each <p> section should only contain one paragraph with no line breaks.  Inside of paragraphs, please use the <b></b> tag for bolded text, <i></i> for italicized text, <u></u> for underlined text, and <span class="magenta"></span> for magenta text enclosing the relevant text.

        <p>[[Facilitator guide paragraph]]</p>

Unordered/Ordered list example.  These are overused in the facilitator guides and are the most time consuming to set up because they are often nested many levels, and sometimes nested within paragraphs (<p>). Here as an example of how these should look, note where the text is located in the [[Item 2]] example in relation to it's nested list:

<ul>
    <li>[[Item 1]]</li>
    <li>[[Item 2]]
        <ul>
            <li>[[Sub-item 1]]</li>
            <li>[[Sub-item 2]]</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>[[Item 3]]</li>
</ul>

Replace <ul></ul> with <ol></ol> for ordered lists, and don't worry if the type of ordering is different than what the facilitator guide shows (T-Mobile is pretty inconsistent about it's ording system). Here are some samples to copy:

        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

    </ol>    
    <p><b>If everyone already knows each other, then have them pick a favorite color instead of repeating the name.</b></p>
    <p>Round 2: Approximately 3 minutes</p>
    <ol>
        <li>After one round, say "Well done! Now let's see if we can do that again, making sure we use the same order and using each other's names. Remember to say the name of the person you are tossing to, and thank the person, by name, for tossing it to you."</li>
        <li>On the second round, take it slow. Help the group out, so that each person has a successful second round.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Round 3: Approximately 3 minutes</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Say, "Good, so how about we do it again, but this time, let's see how fast we can do it, OK? Here we go... Hi Freddy, my name is James..." [toss]</li>
        <li>It will go fast this time, and the group will probably feel quite pleased with themselves.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Round 4: Approximately 3 minutes</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Say, "That's great, but I think you can go faster than that! Come on, let's see how fast we can really go..." [Then, toss and say the name with super-fast enthusiasm to set the tone.]</li>
        <li>After the first ball has been passed through a few hands, take a second ball out of your pocket and casually say, "Hi Freddy..." [toss].</li>
        <li>By now everyone is so well-trained, the second ball will automatically keep going, and there will be a detectable sense of challenge/excitement.</li>
        <li>After a bit, introduce the third and fourth ball, up to about six balls and let them be juggled for a while. A group of twelve can usually handle four to six quite well.</li>
        <li>Once the group seems competent at four to six balls, gradually introduce an unmanageable number of balls into the juggle and maybe also some other items (like soft toys).</li>
    </ol>
