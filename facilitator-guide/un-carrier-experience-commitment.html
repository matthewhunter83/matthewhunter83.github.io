<!--Comments and examples - Collapsible section of code

Slide example. Replace [[Image URL]] with the url for the image in both locations. Slides should be placed logically between facilitator guide elements which may mean sometimes they are inbetween two paragraphs or lists.

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=[[Image URL]]"><img class="slide" src="[[Image URL]]"></a></div>

Topic example. This creates a magenta bar separating major sections of content and matches the magenta bars on the orientation guide.

        <h2>[[Topic]]</h2>

Action example. This creates a gray bar within a topic to further separate larger sections into smaller ones and is in the left column of the page.  Actions should not be present before the first topic.

        <h3>[[Action]]</h3>

Segment Topic example.  Page 3 of the Un-carrier Experience Principles facilitator guide has a few examples of this infrequently used element with the words Customer Focus and Simplicity.  Segment Topics are not sticky so they won't cling to the top of the window on the html, but they look different than bolded text on the rendered html.

        <h4>[[Segment Topic]]</h4>

Paragraph example.  Most of the facilitator guide is written in paragraphs.  Each <p> section should only contain one paragraph with no line breaks.  Inside of paragraphs, please use the <b></b> tag for bolded text, <i></i> for italicized text, <u></u> for underlined text, and <span class="magenta"></span> for magenta text enclosing the relevant text.

        <p>[[Facilitator guide paragraph]]</p>

Unordered/Ordered list example.  These are overused in the facilitator guides and are the most time consuming to set up because they are often nested many levels, and sometimes nested within paragraphs (<p>). Here as an example of how these should look, note where the text is located in the [[Item 2]] example in relation to it's nested list:

<ul>
    <li>[[Item 1]]</li>
    <li>[[Item 2]]
        <ul>
            <li>[[Sub-item 1]]</li>
            <li>[[Sub-item 2]]</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>[[Item 3]]</li>
</ul>

Replace <ul></ul> with <ol></ol> for ordered lists, and don't worry if the type of ordering is different than what the facilitator guide shows (T-Mobile is pretty inconsistent about it's ording system). Here are some samples to copy:

        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

<h2>Intro</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Using everything they learned today about the Un-carrier Experience, learners will create a commitment statement starting with I Will...</p>

        <!--Slide 1--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199316931018772/498889598571642880/Slide1.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199316931018772/498889598571642880/Slide1.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>Explain the following in your own words:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We've talked today about how our customer interactions, our products and services, and the way we work with each other are all a part of the Un-carrier Experience.</li>
        <li>Our Principles are the foundational truth of how we do business. They guide us to the right decisions and make sure we deliver on the Un-carrier Promise to be about the customer.</li>
        <li>Our How We Play Values are the way we turn those Principles into action. Those values help us make sure our customers have the Un-carrier Experience every time they interact with T-Mobile.</li>
        <li>But all this is talk. And saying it and doing it are two different things. To move us from thinking to doing, we're going to create an I Will... commitment statement.</li>
        <li>Each one of us is committed to providing that customer experience to every customer no matter why they are in our store.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Bring It Together Activity</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Give the learners five minutes to create their I Will... commitment statements.</p>

        <!--Slide 2--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199316931018772/498889630842748969/Slide2.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199316931018772/498889630842748969/Slide2.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>I Will Commitment</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Tell the learners to think about everything they've learned about the Un-carrier Experience today. What resonated with them? Did they see or hear about the type of T-Mobile person they want to be? What Principle or How We Play value will be the foundation of their T-Mobile career?</li>
        <li>Tell them they will have five minutes to create their I Will... commitment statement in their Participant Guide.</li>
        <li>Give them your personal I Will... commitment statement so they have an example to go on.</li>
    </ol>

        <!--Slide 3--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199316931018772/498889648165093395/Slide3.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199316931018772/498889648165093395/Slide3.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Debrief</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>At the end of five minutes, ask for volunteers to share their I Will... commitment statement with the group. Take as many volunteers as you have time for.</li>
        <li>Tell the learners that they will have a home store visit as part of Ready! They will share their I Will commitment statement with their store manager and create a plan to make that commitment a reality.</li>
    </ul>

        <!--Slide 4--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199316931018772/498889659410022412/Slide4.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199316931018772/498889659410022412/Slide4.png"></a></div>

    <h4>Day Closing Comments</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask if there are any questions about today's content.</li>
        <li>Close the day with these key points.
            <ul>
