<!--Comments and examples - Collapsible section of code

Slide example. Replace [[Image URL]] with the url for the image in both locations. Slides should be placed logically between facilitator guide elements which may mean sometimes they are inbetween two paragraphs or lists.

        <div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=[[Image URL]]"><img class="slide" src="[[Image URL]]"></a></div>

Topic example. This creates a magenta bar separating major sections of content and matches the magenta bars on the orientation guide.

        <h2>[[Topic]]</h2>

Action example. This creates a gray bar within a topic to further separate larger sections into smaller ones and is in the left column of the page.  Actions should not be present before the first topic.

        <h3>[[Action]]</h3>

Segment Topic example.  Page 3 of the Un-carrier Experience Principles facilitator guide has a few examples of this infrequently used element with the words Customer Focus and Simplicity.  Segment Topics are not sticky so they won't cling to the top of the window on the html, but they look different than bolded text on the rendered html.

        <h4>[[Segment Topic]]</h4>

Paragraph example.  Most of the facilitator guide is written in paragraphs.  Each <p> section should only contain one paragraph with no line breaks.  Inside of paragraphs, please use the <b></b> tag for bolded text, <i></i> for italicized text, <u></u> for underlined text, and <span class="magenta"></span> for magenta text enclosing the relevant text.

        <p>[[Facilitator guide paragraph]]</p>

Unordered/Ordered list example.  These are overused in the facilitator guides and are the most time consuming to set up because they are often nested many levels, and sometimes nested within paragraphs (<p>). Here as an example of how these should look, note where the text is located in the [[Item 2]] example in relation to it's nested list:

<ul>
    <li>[[Item 1]]</li>
    <li>[[Item 2]]
        <ul>
            <li>[[Sub-item 1]]</li>
            <li>[[Sub-item 2]]</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>[[Item 3]]</li>
</ul>

Replace <ul></ul> with <ol></ol> for ordered lists, and don't worry if the type of ordering is different than what the facilitator guide shows (T-Mobile is pretty inconsistent about it's ording system). Here are some samples to copy:

        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

        <!--Slide 7--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199385973325845/499601254104956929/Slide7.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199385973325845/499601254104956929/Slide7.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>We personalize every customer interaction to make the best use of your time.</p>
    <p><b>Be your Un-carrier self</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Being your Un-carrier self is about you creating a space for customers to connect with you on a real and authentic level.</li>
        <li>You should use everyday language that makes the customer feel comfortable and at ease.</li>
        <li>Use your personal experiences when appropriate in your conversation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ask</h3>
    <p>Take a minute to think of a business where the employees are genuinely themselves. How do you feel when you're there?</p>

        <!--Slide 8--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199385973325845/499601265282646037/Slide8.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199385973325845/499601265282646037/Slide8.png"></a></div>

   <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p><b>Have a two-way conversation</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A two-way conversation happens when both people feel heard and understood.</li>
        <li>This is not simply about two people saying exchanging greetings. It's about getting side-by-side, sharing the tools you have, and showing your customer what you see, literally. We're not hiding behind a counter and we're not hiding information.</li>
        <li>A huge part of two-way conversations is your ability to listen, ask meaningful questions, and involve the customer in finding solutions that work for them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ask</h3>
    <p>How can you ensure you're having a two-way conversation with each customer?</p>

        <!--Slide 9--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199385973325845/499601281397293062/Slide9.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199385973325845/499601281397293062/Slide9.png"></a></div>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p><b>Spend time on what matters</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>When people feel like their time is respected, their respect and trust for you increases. Show respect for the customer's time by starting with the original reason for their visit.</li>
        <li>Find out what the customer already knows about T-Mobile so that you can tailor your conversation to what interests them and avoid covering things they don't really care about.</li>
        <li>How you spend your time is also about recognizing when someone is in a hurry, and needs your help, fast!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ask</h3>
    <p>How do you feel when you're shopping and the employee helping you goes on and on about things that don't interest you? Do you feel heard? Do you trust them?</p>

        <!--Slide 10--><div class="image"><a href="fmp://$/filename?.fmp12/?script=send_post&$channel=text&$image_url=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199385973325845/499601304658640896/Slide10.png"><img class="slide" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498199385973325845/499601304658640896/Slide10.png"></a></div>



    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>Match needs to Un-carrier moves (This is the starred/priority behavior).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It takes practice to know all the amazing devices, plans, and services we offer at T-Mobile, and that's okay.</li>
        <li>To make things easier for you and your customer, deliberately ask customers to tell you about their experience and pain points. This is how you avoid guessing, and start working on what matters to your customers.</li>
        <li>Guide the conversation to match the customer's needs to specific Un-carrier moves. What this means is making sure you're connecting what T-Mobile has to offer, with what your customer cares about. Asking questions and exploring options is always good, just be sure you're not accidentally running down a list that isn't related to your customer's needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p><b>Have Serious Fun!</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>One of the things that makes T-Mobile such a great company is the fact we really do have a lot of fun... seriously!</li>
        <li>To provide the best service experience ever, we want you to bring your energy and excitement to work to share with your team and your customrs. Doing so makes it possible to go beyond the basics, and you can do this when you:
            <ul>
                <li>Are curious about the person you're working with. Find out what they like and how they rock T-Mobile.</li>
                <li>Have fun learning about them and building a T-Mobile relationship. Take the curiosity out to the sales floor as you get to know customers.</li>
                <li>Acknowledge their tenure and loyalty and celebrate it with a kind word.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For new customers, connect and share your enthusiasm for being on team magenta.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>We want customers to see, try, and feel their options. Jump in and have fun exploring with them!</p>
    <p><b>Explore hands on, side by side</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the personal connection you've made to suggest things to explore, like apps, OS, or device features. If you don't know, ask!</li>
        <li>To keep that connection going and guide their exploration, join the fun! Help them experience our products and services.</li>
        <li>Use our interactive displays and demos as your exploring with the customer.</li>
        <li>When using your REMO tablet, get next to the customer, as you explore. This makes the interaction open and honest and builds trust.</li>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Customer problems -- they happen to everone. We get it. We'll listen, answer questions, resolve issues, whatever's needed, with empathy.</li>
        <li>Customer issues offer us a chance to truly build trust and strengthen our relationships. After all, it's easy to be great when things are going well. It's being great when the chips are down that shows who we are!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Listen, show empathy, and apologize (This is the starred/priority behavior).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use eye contact and body language to show interest. Most of your message is made up of your non-verbal communication!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ask</h3>
    <p>What is something you can do with your body to show interest?</p>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When there is an issue, one of the main things people want is to be truly heard. Focus on hearing what the customers are saying and confirm you understand what they have said.</li>

        <li>Use empathetic statements to acknowledge concerns and apologize for negative experiences.</li>
        <li>Be sincere. After body language and facial expressions, the next biggest part of your communicated message is tone of voice!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ask</h3>
    <p>What are some ways to respond with empathy to a customer issue?</p>

    <h3>Explain</h3>
    <p>Explain the following in your own words:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Un-carrier Experience Customer Survey is how we hear how we're doing -- straight from our customers!</li>
        <li>Customers rate aspects of their experience, including how likely they are to recommend... all based on YOUR interaction with them!</li>
        <li>That likelihood to recommend is called the Net Promoter Score.</li>
        <li>Customers can even request we contact them, based off their experience. And of course, we do it!</li>
        <li>You will learn all about this survey in your path to Mobile Expert, but you will be impacting customer experience and your survey results as soon as you start working with customers!</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>When we “Make it Personal,” how will “Match Needs to Un-carrier Moves” increase your survey scores?</li>
        <li>When we “Explore and Discover,” how does “Own the Network” deliver a better customer experience in the store?</li>
        <li>And what about “Problem Solved?” How will “Listen, show empathy, and apologize” impact the customer survey?</li>
        <li>When you “Guide the Purchase,” how does that create a better customer experience?</li>
        <li>When you offer to “Stay Connected,” how does “Set the right expectations” help you achieve a favorable Net Promoter Score? </li>
