<p>I chose to analyze Book XVIII of The Odyssey.  At this point in the story, Ulysses wife, Penelope, is entertaining suitors and considering remarrying.  Despite the context of the story, there is a wealth of information revealed about Ancient Greek culture in the book.</p>

<p>For instance, this quote reveals information about food preparation:</p>

<blockquote>Ulysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat's paunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took two loaves out of the bread-basket and brought them to him, pledging him as he did so in a golden goblet of wine.</blockquote>

<p>Later, the poem descibes courting rituals of the time:</p>

<blockquote>With these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but attended by two of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on either side of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and became so desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he might win her for his own bed fellow.</blockquote>

<p>Further into the book, there is a description of the role of maids in Ancient Greece:</p>

<blockquote>"Maids, servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent, go to the queen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick wool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till morning, but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal."</blockquote>

<p>In another passage, we learn about agricultural practices and tools:</p>

<blockquote>"Eurymachus," answered Ulysses, "if you and I were to work one against the other in early summer when the days are at their longest- give me a good scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which will fast the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when the mowing grass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us each take a yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and endurance: turn me into a four acre field, and see whether you or I can drive the straighter furrow. </blockquote>
