        <h4>VIDEO OVERVIEW</h4>
        <p>A frustrated customer comes into a T-Mobile store after experiencing issues with dropped calls. They have an older device, and there have been significant network upgrades in the area recently. The Mobile Expert has to figure out how to tactfully show empathy, diffuse the tension, and solve the customer’s problem.</p>
        <h4>POSITIVE STUFF</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Mobile Expert solves the customer’s problem.</li>
            <li>The Mobile Expert nails Stay Connected, making sure to schedule a touch-
                base with the customer to ensure their issue is resolved.</li>
            <li>The Mobile Expert owns our network.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Mobile Expert struggles to show empathy at the beginning of the interaction, though they apologize for this once the customer has calmed down.</li>
            <li>The Mobile Expert does not immediately take full ownership of the issue, because they know that the issue shouldn’t be happening due to recent network improvements.</li>
            <li>The customer accuses the Mobile Expert of trying to upsell them on a new device when coverage was their big concern. How could the Mobile Expert have avoided that?</li>
            <li>Even though the customer says they don’t care about what 4G LTE means, the Mobile Expert continues to use that terminology.</li>
        </ul>
