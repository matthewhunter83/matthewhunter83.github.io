        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Customer experience videos appear throughout the Ready! roadmap.</li>
            <li>The videos are a fun way to bring the Interaction Model to life, and start the day off with some serious fun energy and interesting discussion.</li>
            <li>These videos are meant to model <b>average</b> customer interactions.
                <ul>
                    <li><span>NOT</span> “what right looks like” or “what wrong looks like.”</li>
                    <li>The videos leave room for opportunity – on purpose!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For each video, this facilitator guide will give you:
                <ul>
                    <li>A high-level description of the video.</li>
                    <li>Which Interaction Model behaviors are covered in the video.</li>
                    <li>Callouts for the main positive behaviors and areas of opportunity.</li>
                    <li>A few debrief questions. Feel free to add your own, of course! We’ll use the ones from the observation guide for consistency.</li>
                </ul>
