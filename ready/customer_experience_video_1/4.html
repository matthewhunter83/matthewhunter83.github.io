        <h4>VIDEO OVERVIEW</h4>
        <p>A new customer is interested in switching to the Un-carrier because of overages with their current carrier while traveling internationally. The Mobile Expert has many opportunities to be their Un-carrier self and explain "“"Why T-Mobile."</p>
        <h4>POSITIVE STUFF</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The decision to upgrade the device is left to the customer – no pressure here!</li>
            <li>The Mobile Expert does a nice job of matching signature moves to the customer’s situation and explaining "Why T-Mobile."</li>
            <li>The Mobile Expert asked great questions to avoid pitfalls – Mobile Without Borders is great for occasional travelers (we shouldn’t avoid selling someone an international plan if they travel internationally frequently).</li>
            <li>The Mobile Expert explains the benefits of multiple rate plans and doesn’t try to just sell the more expensive plan because the customer is willing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Mobile Expert fumbles the credit check conversation. How could they have asked to run credit in a better way?</li>
            <li>The Mobile Expert could have touched on <span>all</span> the signature moves relevant to this customer and tied them into the overage pain point: Mobile Without Borders, Simple Global, taxes and fees included, etc.</li>
        </ul>
