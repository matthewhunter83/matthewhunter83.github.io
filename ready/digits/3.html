        <h3>Ask</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Does anyone have any firsthand experience with DIGITS? Maybe you or someone you know uses the service? Or have you heard overheard any sales conversations about DIGITS?</li>
            <li>Allow a few minutes for discussion before moving on to set up the DIY activity.
                </li>
            <li>If no one has experience, here’s a scenario:
                <ul>
                    <li>Jennifer would like to have one number to give her business contacts and one for her personal life but she doesn’t want to carry two phones.</li>
                    <li>With DIGITS, she can have multiple phone numbers on one device. T- Mobile can just add DIGITS Talk & Text plan to her account. She will be able to manage both numbers from one phone.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
