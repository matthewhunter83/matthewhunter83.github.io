        <h3>Handoffs</h3>
        <p>Every situation is different but these are the basic guidelines for handoffs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are times when a small business sale should be handed off to the T-Mobile for Business Account Executive (AE).</li>
            <li>Each company owned store is assigned an AE and youâ€™ll meet yours when you get back to your home store.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> If you are in a TPR location, work with your manager if you find a lead with one of these situations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Explain the information on the handoffs slide. Add in these possible situations.
                <ul>
                    <li>There are multiple decision makers in the business.</li>
                    <li>The business has multiple locations.</li>
                    <li>The business needs complex wireless solutions like SyncUP FLEET.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Tell the learners that when they encounter a business lead they should get the store manager or experienced Mobile Expert involved early in the sale. That person will help them determine whether they should keep or handoff the sale or lead.</li>
        </ul>
