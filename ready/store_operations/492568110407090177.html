        <h3>Explain</h3>
        <p>Explain the following in your own words:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Store Operations are what happens behind the scenes.</li>
            <li>They keep your store running smoothly and positively impact OpEx results. That’s a fancy way of labeling operating expenses.</li>
            <li>Various sales tasks, keeping inventory secure, and making sure the store is clean all effect the customer experience and yours, too!</li>
            <li>Think about the promotions we all love! The funds required to make campaigns like that successful come from the collective effort of everyone running an operationally sound location.</li>
            <li>You’re going to use the rest of the day to get familiar with some of the everyday tasks of your store.</li>
        </ul>
